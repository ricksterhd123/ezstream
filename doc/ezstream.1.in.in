.Nm ezstream
.Nd source client for Icecast with external de-/encoder support
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command line source client for media streams, primarily for streaming
to Icecast servers.
.Pp
It allows the creation of media streams based on input from files or standard
input that is piped through an optional external de- and encoder.
As every part of this chain is highly configurable, ezstream can be useful in
a large number of streaming setups.
.Ss Command line arguments
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Use the XML configuration in
.Ar configfile .
.It Fl h
Print a summary of available command line arguments with short descriptions
and exit.
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
Write the
.Nm
process ID
.Pq a single number
to
.Ar pidfile .
The file will be written even when it already exists.
A file lock is maintained until the main
.Nm
process terminates.
If the file cannot be written for any reason,
.Nm
will log this, but not consider it a fatal error.
.It Fl q
Be more quiet.
Suppress the output that external programs send to standard error.
.It Fl r
Maintain a line of real-time status information about the stream on standard
output.
.Po
Implies
.Fl q .
.Pc
.It Fl s Ar file
Run
.Nm
as a line-based shuffling utility.
If a
.Ar playlist
argument of
.Dq -
is given, a list of media file names is read from standard input
instead of an input file.
After successfully reading the entire list, it is shuffled and printed to
standard output, and
.Nm
will exit.
.It Fl V
Print the
.Nm
version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Increase logging verbosity.
May be used up to three times to also include debug logging output.
.El
.Ss Runtime control
.Nm Ezstream
offers limited runtime control via signals.
By sending a signal to the ezstream process, e.g. with the
.Xr kill 1
utility, a certain action will be triggered.
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Cd SIGHUP
Rereads the playlist file after the track that is currently streamed.
If the playlist is not to be shuffled,
.Nm
attempts to find the previously streamed file and continue with the one
following it, or restarts from the beginning of the list otherwise.
.It Cd SIGUSR1
Skips the currently playing track and moves on to the next in playlist mode, or
restarts the current track when streaming a single file.
.It Cd SIGUSR2
Triggers rereading of metadata for the stream by running the configured
program or script.
This is the only meaningful signal when streaming from standard input.
.El
.Pp
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
The
.Nm
utility uses a simple XML configuration file format.
It has a tree-like structure and is made up of
.Em XML elements .
Of all the possible XML features, only regular elements that contain text or
other elements, and comments, appear in an
.Nm
configuration file.
.Pp
Each element in the configuration file consists of a
.Em start tag ,
its content, and an
.Em end tag .
For example:
.Pp
.Dl \&<filename\&>playlist.m3u<\&/filename\&>
.Dl \&<\&!-- XML comments look like this. --\&>
.Sh XML CONFIGURATION
In this section, each available element is listed and described.
Note that for this purpose, elements are introduced in their short, i.e. empty
form.
In the configuration file, they need to be used as
.Em start tag + content + end tag ,
like in the introductory example shown above.

from standard input into a supported stream format on standard output.
.Pp
Metadata placeholders may be used here.

.El
.Sh SCRIPTING
The
.Nm
utility provides hooks for externally controlled playlist and metadata
management.
This is done by running external programs or scripts that need to behave in
ways explained here.
.Ss Common Rules
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
The program must be an executable file.
.It
The program must write one line to standard output and exit.
.It
The program must not require arbitrary command line options to function.
A wrapper script must be used if there is no other way.
.El
.Ss Playlist Programs
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
The program must return only filenames, with one filename per execution.
.It
The program should not return an empty line unless
.Nm
is supposed to know that the end of the playlist has been reached.
This is significant when the
.Li \&<stream_once/\&>
option is enabled.
.El
.Ss Metadata Programs
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
The program must not return anything (just a newline character is okay) if it
is called by
.Nm
with a command line argument that the program does not support.
.It
When called without command line arguments, the program should return a
complete string that should be used for metadata.
.It
When called with the command line argument
.Qq Li artist ,
the program should return only the artist information of the metadata.
.Pq Optional.
.It
When called with the command line argument
.Qq Li title ,
the program should return only the title information of the metadata.
.Pq Optional.
.It
The supplied metadata must be encoded in UTF-8.
.El
.Sh METADATA
The main tool for handling metadata with
.Nm
is placeholders in decoder and encoder commands that are replaced with real
content during runtime.
.Pp
.Em Note:
All placeholders are replaced with content enclosed in single quotes, with
escaped single quote and backslash characters in between, so that
interpretation by the shell does not occur.
.Em \&Do not add any additional quoting!
.Ss Metadata Placeholders
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Sy @T@
Replaced with the media file name.
Required in
.Li /ezstream/decoders/decoder/program .
Available in
.Li /ezstream/metadata/format_str .
.It Sy @M@
Replaced with a metadata string.
.Pq See below for a detailed explanation.
Available in
.Li /ezstream/decoders/decoder/program
and
.Li /ezstream/encoders/encoder/program .
.It Sy @a@
Replaced with the artist information.
Available in
.Li /ezstream/decoders/decoder/program ,
.Li /ezstream/encoders/encoder/program
and
.Li /ezstream/metadata/format_str .
.It Sy @t@
Replaced with the title information.
Available in
.Li /ezstream/decoders/decoder/program ,
.Li /ezstream/encoders/encoder/program
and
.Li /ezstream/metadata/format_str .
.It Sy @b@
Replaced with the album information.
Available in
.Li /ezstream/decoders/decoder/program ,
.Li /ezstream/encoders/encoder/program
and
.Li /ezstream/metadata/format_str .
.It Sy @s@
Replaced with the string returned by
.Li /ezstream/metadata/program
when called without any command line arguments.
Available only in
.Li /ezstream/metadata/format_str .
.El
.Ss The @M@ Placeholder
While all other placeholders are simply replaced with whatever data they are
associated with,
.Sq Li @M@
is context-sensitive.
The logic used by
.Nm
is the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
If ('@M@ is present')
    If (/ezstream/metadata/program AND /ezstream/metadata/format_str)
        Replace with format string result.
    Else
        If (NOT /ezstream/metadata/program AND '@t@ is present')
            Replace with empty string.
        else
            Replace with generated metadata string.
        Endif
    Endif
Endif
.Ed
.Pp
The generated metadata string for
.Sq Li @M@
is of the format
.Dq Em Artist - Title ,
if both artist and title information is available.
If one of the two is missing, the available one is displayed without a leading
or trailing dash, e.g. just
.Dq Em Artist .
If neither artist nor title are available, the name of the media file \(em
without its file extension \(em is used.
.Ss Metadata Caveats
It is possible to generate strange results with odd combinations of
placeholders, external metadata programs and updates during runtime via
.Sy SIGUSR2 .
If things start to become just confusing, simplify.
.Pp
Metadata updates during runtime are done with a eccentric feature of libshout.
Additional metadata information that is already present in the stream sent via
.Nm
is usually destroyed and replaced with the new data.
It is not possible to properly discern between artist and title information,
which means that anything set with the
.Sy SIGUSR2
feature will continue to end up entirely in the
.Qq Em Title
field of a stream.
.Pp
Additional limitations in Icecast may apply as well, where one historic
example is that of all possible Ogg-based streams, only Ogg Vorbis can have
its metadata manipulated.
.Pp
The ID3v1 tags
.Pq relevant when streaming in MP3 format
do not specify any character encoding, so
.Nm
operates in a manner of
.Dq best effort .
In case of encoding issues, it may help to explicitly set a codeset to work
with via the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
environment variable, as
.Nm
assumes ID3v1 tags to be in the user's current locale.
Note that, even though support for different locales is provided by
.Nm ,
Icecast itself and the listening clients also have a say in the matter.
The only way to ensure consistent results with metadata in non-Ogg streams is
to use only the characters available in the ISO-8859-1 codeset.
.Pp
External encoders may put additional, and possibly artificial, restrictions on
valid characters in metadata.
